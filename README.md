## Welcome to Yu's presentations.
Here you find presentations by Yu Wang.

I am currently a PhD student in astronomy, studying planet formation etc. [Here](http://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~cormel/NewSite/) you find the website of our group in Department of Astronomy, Tsinghua Univerity, China.

Contact ðŸ“§ <Wang-y21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn> with any problems. 

Please refer to me if you want to use any figures labelled as Â©Yu or any figures not labelled. Usually they are both created by me.

Hope we all learn something!
